\usage{
permMclustGene(y, adjust.perms, nperms, condition, remove.zeroes = TRUE,
  log.transf = TRUE, restrict = TRUE, alpha, m0, s0, a0, b0, C, ref)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Numeric data vector for one gene}

\item{adjust.perms}{Logical indicating whether or not to adjust the permutation tests for the sample
detection rate (proportion of nonzero values).  If true, the residuals of a linear model adjusted for 
detection rate are permuted, and new fitted values are obtained using these residuals.}

\item{nperms}{Number of permutations of residuals to evaulate}

\item{condition}{A character object that contains the name of the column in \code{phenoData} that represents 
the biological group or condition of interest (e.g. treatment versus control).  Note that this variable should only contain two 
possible values since \code{scDD} can currently only handle two-group comparisons.  The default option assumes that there
is a column named "condition" that contains this variable.}

\item{remove.zeroes}{Logical indicating whether zeroes need to be removed from \code{y}}

\item{log.transf}{Logical indicating whether the data is in the raw scale (if so, will be log-transformed)}

\item{restrict}{Logical indicating whether to perform restricted Mclust clustering where close-together clusters are joined.}

\item{alpha}{Value for the Dirichlet concentration parameter}

\item{m0}{Prior mean value for generating distribution of cluster means}

\item{s0}{Prior precision value for generating distribution of cluster means}

\item{a0}{Prior shape parameter value for the generating distribution of cluster precision}

\item{b0}{Prior scale parameter value for the generating distribution of cluster precision}

\item{C}{Matrix of confounder variables, where there is one row for each sample and one column for each covariate.}

\item{ref}{one of two possible values in condition; represents the referent category.}

\value{
Bayes factor numerator for the current permutation
}
\description{
Function to obtain bayes factor for all permutations of one gene (not parallelized; to be used when parallelizing over Genes)
}
\details{
Obtains bayes factor for data vector \code{y} representing one gene
