\usage{
classifyDD(pe_mat, condition, sig_genes, oa, c1, c2, alpha, m0, s0, a0, b0,
  log.nonzero = TRUE, ref)
}
\arguments{
\item{pe_mat}{Matrix with genes in rows and samples in columns.  Column names 
indicate condition.}

\item{condition}{Vector of condition indicators (with two possible values).}

\item{sig_genes}{Vector of the indices of significantly DD genes (indicating the row
number of \code{pe_mat})}

\item{oa}{List item with one item for each gene where the first element contains the cluster membership for 
each nonzero sample in the overall (pooled) fit.}

\item{c1}{List item with one item for each gene where the first element contains the cluster membership for 
each nonzero sample in condition 1 only fit}

\item{c2}{List item with one item for each gene where the first element contains the cluster membership for 
each nonzero sample in condition 2 only fit}

\item{alpha}{Value for the Dirichlet concentration parameter}

\item{m0}{Prior mean value for generating distribution of cluster means}

\item{s0}{Prior precision value for generating distribution of cluster means}

\item{a0}{Prior shape parameter value for the generating distribution of cluster precision}

\item{b0}{Prior scale parameter value for the generating distribution of cluster precision}

\item{log.nonzero}{Logical indicating whether to perform log transformation of nonzero values.}

\item{ref}{one of two possible values in condition; represents the referent category.}
}
\value{
cat Character vector of the same length as \code{sig_genes} that indicates which category of 
 DD each significant gene belongs to (DE, DP, DM, DB, or NC (no call))
}
\description{
Classify significantly DD genes into the four categories (DE, DP, DM or DB) based on posterior distributions of cluster mean parameters
