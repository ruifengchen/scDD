\usage{
calcMV(a, FC = 1, FC.thresh = NA, threshold = Inf,
  include.zeroes = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{Numeric vector of values to calculate empirical mean and variance.}

\item{FC}{Fold change for the mean and standard deviation.  Default value is 1.}

\item{FC.thresh}{Alternate fold change for the mean and standard deviation when the (log nonzero) mean is above the value of \code{threshold}.
Default value is \code{FC}.}

\item{threshold}{Mean threshold value which dictates which fold change value to use for multiplying mean and standard deviation.
Default value is Inf (so \code{FC} is always used).}

\item{include.zeroes}{Logical value indicating whether the zero values should be included in the calculations of the empirical means 
and variances.}
}
\value{
MV Vector of two elements, first contains the empirical mean estimate, second contains the empirical variance estimate (optionally 
  multiplied by a fold change).
}
\description{
Calculate empirical means and variances of selected genes in a given dataset.
}
\details{
Calculate empirical means and variances of selected genes in a given dataset. Optionally, multiply
 the means and standard deviations by a fold change value, which can also vary by mean value.  If the mean is
 below some specified threshold \code{threshold}, use one fold change value \code{FC}.  If above the threshold, use the alternate 
 fold change value \code{FC.thresh}.  Estimates of mean and variance are robust to outliers.
