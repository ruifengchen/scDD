\usage{
findIndex(SCdat, condition = "condition")
}
\arguments{
\item{SCdat}{An object of class \code{ExpressionSet} that contains normalized single-cell expression and metadata, where the \code{assayData} 
slot contains one row for each gene and one sample for each column.  The \code{PhenoData} slot should contain a vector of numeric values
(either 1 or 2) that indicates which 
condition each sample belongs to (in the same order as the columns of \code{assayData}).  Optional additional metadata about the 
experiment can be contained in the \code{experimentData} slot.}

\item{condition}{A character object that contains the name of the column in \code{phenoData} that represents 
the biological group or condition of interest (e.g. treatment versus control).  Note that this variable should only contain two 
possible values since \code{scDD} can currently only handle two-group comparisons.  The default option assumes that there
is a column named "condition" that contains this variable.}
}
\value{
Vector of indices for a reasonable set of genes that can be used for simulation.
}
\description{
Find a reasonable set of genes (one mode and at least 25% nonzero values) to use for simulation.
