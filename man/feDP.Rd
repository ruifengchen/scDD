\usage{
feDP(pe_mat, condition, sig_genes, oa, c1, c2, log.nonzero = TRUE,
  testZeroes = FALSE, adjust.perms = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pe_mat}{Matrix with genes in rows and samples in columns.  Column names 
indicate condition.}

\item{condition}{Vector of condition indicators (with two possible values).}

\item{sig_genes}{Vector of the indices of significantly DD genes (indicating the row
number of \code{pe_mat})}

\item{oa}{List item with one item for each gene where the first element contains the cluster membership for 
each nonzero sample in the overall (pooled) fit.}

\item{c1}{List item with one item for each gene where the first element contains the cluster membership for 
each nonzero sample in condition 1 only fit}

\item{c2}{List item with one item for each gene where the first element contains the cluster membership for 
each nonzero sample in condition 2 only fit}

\item{log.nonzero}{Logical indicating whether to perform log transformation of nonzero values.}

\item{testZeroes}{Logical indicating whether or not to test for a difference in the proportion of zeroes}

\item{adjust.perms}{Logical indicating whether or not to adjust the permutation tests for the sample
detection rate (proportion of nonzero values).  If true, the residuals of a linear model adjusted for 
detection rate are permuted, and new fitted values are obtained using these residuals.}
}
\value{
cat Character vector of the same length as \code{sig_genes} that indicates which nonsignificant genes by
 the permutation test belong to the DP category
}
\description{
Function to identify additional DP genes, since clustering process can be consistent within each condition 
  and still have differential proportion within each mode.  The Bayes factor score also tends to be small when
  the correct number of clusters is not correctly detected; in that case differential proportion will manifest
  as a mean shift.
}
\details{
The Fisher's Exact test is used to test for independence of condition membership and clustering when 
  the clustering is the same across conditions as it is overall (and is multimodal). When clustering within 
  condition is not multimodal or is different across conditions (most often the case), an FDR-adjusted t-test
  is performed to detect overall mean shifts.
