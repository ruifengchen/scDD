\usage{
findFC(SCdat, index, sd.range = c(1, 3), N = 4, overExpressionProb = 0.5,
  plot.FC = FALSE, condition = "condition")
}
\arguments{
\item{SCdat}{An object of class \code{ExpressionSet} that contains normalized single-cell expression and metadata, where the \code{assayData} 
slot contains one row for each gene and one sample for each column.  The \code{PhenoData} slot should contain a vector of numeric values
(either 1 or 2) that indicates which 
condition each sample belongs to (in the same order as the columns of \code{assayData}).  Optional additional metadata about the 
experiment can be contained in the \code{experimentData} slot.}

\item{index}{Reasonable set of genes for simulation}

\item{sd.range}{Numeric vector of length two which describes the interval (lower, upper) of standard deviations
of fold changes to randomly select.}

\item{N}{Integer value for the number of bins to divide range of fold changes for calculating standard deviations}

\item{overExpressionProb}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 which describes the ratio of over to under expression 
values to sample.}

\item{plot.FC}{Logical indicating whether or not to plot the observed and simulated log2 fold changes.}

\item{condition}{A character object that contains the name of the column in \code{phenoData} that represents 
the biological group or condition of interest (e.g. treatment versus control).  Note that this variable should only contain two 
possible values since \code{scDD} can currently only handle two-group comparisons.  The default option assumes that there
is a column named "condition" that contains this variable.}

\description{
Find the appropriate Fold Change vectors for simulation that will be use in classic differential expression case.
}
\details{
This code is a modified version of Sam Younkin's simulate FC function.  Major things that were changed are 
  (1) standard deviations are calculated only on the nonzeroes, (2) the sampling of FCs is uniform on the log scale 
  instead of the raw scale, and (3) the binning is done by quantiles instead of evenly spaced along the average expression
  values.
