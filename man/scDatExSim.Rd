\title{Toy example of simulated data}
\format{An object of class \code{\link[Biobase]{ExpressionSet}} containing data for 30 genes for 200 samples
 (100 from condition 1 and 100 from condition 2).  Condition labels (1 or 2) are stored in the phenoData slot.  
 Row names of the assayData slot contain the two letter category label that the gene was simulated from (e.g.  'EE', 'DB', ...)
 along with the row number (1-30).}
\usage{
data(scDatExSim)
}
\description{
Toy example data in \code{\link[Biobase]{ExpressionSet}} format for 500 genes to illustrate how to generate simulated data from example data
 using \code{\link{simulateSet}}.  Contains 5 genes from each category (DE, DP, DM, DB, EE, and EP).
