\usage{
sideViolin(y, cond, MAP = NULL, logT = TRUE, title.gene = "",
  conditionLabels = unique(cond), axes.titles = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Numeric vector of data to plot.}

\item{cond}{Vector of condition labels corresponding to elements of \code{x}.}

\item{MAP}{List of MAP partition estimates with conditions as list items and samples as elements 
(integer indicating which cluster each observation belongs to; zeroes belong to cluster 1)}

\item{logT}{Logical that indicates whether to take the log(x+1) transformation.}

\item{title.gene}{Character vector that contains the gene name that you are plotting.}

\item{conditionLabels}{Character vector containing the names of the two conditions.}

\item{axes.titles}{Logical indicating whether or not to include axes labels on plots.}
}
\description{
Plots two histograms side by side with smoothed density overlay
